--NOTE: This script replaces a pre-Finale 2011 Patterson Plugin that created staff styles and massaged group names
--to achieve a result that looked like the full names on the first system. But starting in Fin11 all we have to do is
--set a measure option. The only reason to use this script any more is that it may not require as much motor precision
--as opening the meas dialog and clicking an option.
